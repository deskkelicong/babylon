# EPANET Z: A Powerful Tool for Water Distribution Network Analysis
 
EPANET Z is a software application that combines EPANET, a widely used program for simulating water distribution networks, with mapping data from the internet. EPANET Z allows users to view and edit their network models on top of various map sources, such as Google Maps, Yahoo Maps or Virtual Earth. EPANET Z also provides a convenient way to convert network coordinates from UTM to decimal degrees using the online EpaGeo service.
 
EPANET Z is developed by Zonum Solutions, a company that specializes in geospatial solutions for water resources engineering. EPANET Z is based on EPANET 2.0.12, the latest version of EPANET released by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
