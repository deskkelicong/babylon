The 4-4-0 American was not only a popular locomotive type in the United States, but also a historically significant one. It was the first locomotive to cross the continent in 1869, when two 4-4-0s, the Central Pacific's Jupiter and the Union Pacific's No. 119, met at Promontory Summit, Utah, to complete the first transcontinental railroad. It was also the first locomotive to break the 100 mph speed barrier, when New York Central's No. 999 reached 112.5 mph in 1893 while pulling the Empire State Express. [^2^] [^3^]

The 4-4-0 American was widely used for both passenger and freight service, as it could handle various types of terrain and track conditions. It was especially suited for the curvy and hilly routes of the eastern and southern states, where its leading bogie gave it stability and flexibility. The 4-4-0 was also adaptable to different fuel sources, such as wood, coal, or oil. [^1^] [^2^]
 
The 4-4-0 American reached its peak of development and popularity in the late 19th century, when thousands of them were built by various manufacturers, such as Baldwin, Rogers, Cooke, and Schenectady. Some of the most famous 4-4-0s include the DeWitt Clinton , one of the earliest steam locomotives in America; the General , which was involved in the Great Locomotive Chase of the Civil War; and the William Crooks , the first locomotive to operate in Minnesota. [^1^] [^2^]

The 4-4-0 American began to decline in the early 20th century, as railroads demanded more powerful and faster locomotives for their growing traffic. The 4-4-0 was gradually replaced by larger and more modern wheel arrangements, such as the 4-6-0 Ten-wheeler , the 4-6-2 Pacific , and the 4-8-2 Mountain . By the 1920s, most 4-4-0s had been retired or relegated to branch line or switching duties. [^1^] [^2^]
 
Despite their obsolescence, some 4-4-0s survived into the diesel era and even saw occasional service during World War II, when fuel and motive power were scarce. A few 4-4-0s also found new life on tourist railroads and museum displays, where they continue to delight visitors with their classic appearance and historical significance. Some of the most notable preserved 4-4-0s include the replicas of the Jupiter and No. 119 at the Golden Spike National Historical Park in Utah; the original William Crooks at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Minnesota; and the Eureka , a wood-burning 4-4-0 that still operates on special occasions.
