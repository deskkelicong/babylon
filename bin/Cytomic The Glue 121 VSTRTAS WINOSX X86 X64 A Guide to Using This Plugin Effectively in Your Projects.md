### Drum Compression
  
Drums are one of the most important elements in electronic music, and they need to sound punchy and tight. Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 can help you achieve that by applying a gentle compression to the drum bus, or by using it as a parallel compressor on a separate track.
  
To compress the drum bus, you can start with the default preset and adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, and release settings according to your taste and the material. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a gain reduction of around 2-4 dB, and to use a fast attack and a medium release to preserve the transients and the groove.
  
To use Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 as a parallel compressor, you can create a send from the drum bus to an aux track, and insert Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 on that track. Then, you can use more extreme settings, such as a higher ratio, a lower threshold, and a slower attack and release, to create a heavily compressed signal that you can blend with the original signal using the mix knob or the fader.
  
### Vocal Compression
  
Vocals are another crucial element in electronic music, and they need to sound clear and consistent. Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 can help you achieve that by applying a moderate compression to the vocal track, or by using it as a de-esser on a separate track.
  
To compress the vocal track, you can start with the vocal preset and adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, and release settings according to your taste and the material. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a gain reduction of around 4-6 dB, and to use a medium attack and release to smooth out the dynamics and add some warmth.
  
To use Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 as a de-esser, you can create a send from the vocal track to an aux track, and insert Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 on that track. Then, you can use the sidechain filter to focus on the sibilant frequencies (usually around 5-10 kHz), and use a high ratio, a low threshold, and a fast attack and release to reduce them. You can then blend the de-essed signal with the original signal using the mix knob or the fader.
  
### Synth Processing
  
Synths are often used to create melodies, pads, basses, and other sounds in electronic music, and they need to sound rich and full. Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 can help you achieve that by applying a subtle compression to the synth track, or by using it as an effect on a separate track.
  
To compress the synth track, you can start with the synth preset and adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, and release settings according to your taste and the material. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a gain reduction of around 1-3 dB, and to use a slow attack and release to add some color and character.
  
To use Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 as an effect, you can create a send from the synth track to an aux track, and insert Cytomic The Glue 1.2.1 on that track. Then, you can use more creative settings, such as a low ratio, a high threshold, and a fast attack and release, to create a pumping or breathing effect that syncs with the tempo of your song.
